# hello-world
No description necessary

I love digging into data, playing with coding expercises and dabbling in API scripts. And I like people. And being creative. 

Challenging myself to learn new skills for my career and my hobbies. I'm making a mid-life career pivot that just makes sense. 


Cheers!

Bex
